Eclipse OS is an Equinox server that provides access to the local system for browser based UIs like Chrome. This came about when I created a Chrome OS look-a-like based on Fedora and then noticed I needed some way of doing things on the local system. Given how well GWT works with Equinox OSGi/Jetty, it's an obvious choice for creating local web services that provide this access.

This is a long journey to understanding what such an architecture would look like. Things like security come to mind. Provisioning using p2 with a web UI to p2 is probably one of the early services needed. Editing docs and things locally, storing and playing media files, the list can get quite long.

This isn't meant to turn into a product. It's just an instrument of learning. But if it leads somewhere interesting and others are interested in contributing, maybe it can.
